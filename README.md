# Incident Response Simulation

## Overview

The Incident Response Simulation project is a Python-based tool designed to simulate and practice incident response procedures in a controlled environment. This tool provides scenarios and simulations of various cybersecurity incidents to help organizations and teams prepare for real-world security breaches.

## Features

- Simulates cybersecurity incidents (e.g., ransomware attack, data breach).
- Provides interactive scenarios for incident response training.
- Guides users through incident detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery phases.
- Generates reports and metrics on incident handling and response times.
- Supports customization of scenarios and response procedures.
- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for setup and operation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `simpy` library for discrete-event simulation
- `faker` library for generating fake data (optional)
- `pandas` library for data analysis and reporting (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Aravjnth/Incident-Response-Simulation.git
    cd incident-response-simulation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the incident response simulation:
    ```bash
    python simulate_incident.py --scenario <scenario-name>
    ```

2. Follow the prompts and instructions to handle the simulated incident.
3. Review reports and metrics to evaluate incident response effectiveness.

### Example

Start a simulation of a ransomware attack scenario:
```bash
python simulate_incident.py --scenario ransomware
```

## Options

- `--scenario`: Specify the scenario to simulate (e.g., ransomware, data breach).
- Additional configuration options can be customized in `config.py`.
